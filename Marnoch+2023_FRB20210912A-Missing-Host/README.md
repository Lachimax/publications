### Scripts

#### `00_misc_values.py`

Derives some miscellaneous values quoted in the paper.


#### `01_association.py`

Runs PATH (Probabilistic Association of Transients; Aggarwal et al 2021) in various configurations on the imaging data 
covering FRB 20210912A.


#### `02_association_analysis.py`

Derives results related to the PATH (Probabilistic Association of Transients; Aggarwal et al 2021) runs. 
Generates Figure 2.
Must be run AFTER `01_association.py`.


#### `03_imaging_limits.py`

Derives the imaging limits.


#### `04_redshift_hosts.py`

Generates the synthetic magnitudes for our FRB hosts at a range of redshifts.
Uses Prospector SED models generated by Gordon et al 2023.


#### `05_redshift_plots.py`

Generates Figures 3+.
`04_redshift_hosts.py` must be run first.


#### `06_foreground_halos.py`

Uses GAMA DR4 and mNFW profiles to estimate a partial foreground halo contribution to the DM of FRB 
20210912A.


#### `07_scattering.py`

Uses the framework of Cordes et al 2022 to estimate the host dispersion
measure contribution from the scattering timescale.


#### `08_bright_stars.py`

Finds the nuisance stars in Gaia and makes some check plots.


#### `09_frbstats.py`

Uses the FRBSTATS catalogue of FRBs (https://www.herta-experiment.org/frbstats/) to enumerate those that have DM 
consistent with z>1.
